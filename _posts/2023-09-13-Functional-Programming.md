* evaluation of functions
* pure function - output value follows soley from it's input values
* program consists of entirely functions
* computation proceeds by nested or composed function calls - **without changes to state or mutable data**

## Advantages:
* High level - describe the result - single concise statements
* Transparent - behaviour of a pure function depends on it's inputs and outputs (without intermediary values) = no side effects
* Paralellizable - no side effects = easier to run in parallel

## Python Support
Functional programming requires:
1, function as an argument
2, return a function to it's caller

* Functions can be assigned to variables
* Functions can be return values
