Independent deployability
Hiding information
Small interface

Why Independent Development?:

Easier to limit impact for each release.
As team size increases it gets harder to coordinate a deployment (people).

Look at books?

# Building Microservices - Sam Newman

## Part 1

###1 What are Microservices?
* Microservices are independently releasable services that are modeled around a busi‚Äê
ness domain.
* They are a type of service-orientated architecture.
* Independent deployability.
* Treated as a black box.
* Technology agnostic.
* Each microservice encapsulates it's own db.
* Changes inside a microservice should not affect an upstream consumer.



* Microservices is a particular approach to SOA
* To ensure independent deployability microservices must be loosely coupled
* Stable interfaces
* Avoid shared databases - should get data from other ms
* a microservice should be kept to the size at which it can be easily understood.
* incremental migration to ms - turn up the dial gradually



* Distributed monolith if all services are deployed together.
* Microservice architecture gives concrete ownership boundaries
* Monolith is sensible default choice
* Log aggregation - use a single id for for related set of service calls


* how to handle network failure?
* can scale services which need it

* gradually increase use of new Technology
